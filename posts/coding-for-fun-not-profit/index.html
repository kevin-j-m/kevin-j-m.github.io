    <p>I originally wanted to call this post &ldquo;Coding for Fun <del>And Profit</del>&rdquo; with And
Profit in strikethrough, but hugo wouldn't recognize markdown in the title of a
new post, so I gave up immediately and renamed it, which is a perfect
encapsulation of what I'm looking to convey here.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I've been paid to write code for almost 15 years now. I think I'm decent at it,
and I enjoy doing it as a profession, but it's not something I do much of in my
free time. I'm not against people having side projects, spending their free
time how they'd like and doing whatever energizes them, but I write enough code
during the day at work to satisfy my interests there. I'll never get a job
somewhere that requires an extensive personal portfolio to show as proof of
&ldquo;passion&rdquo;. I'm comfortable with that, and privileged enough to be able to say
that.</p>
<p>Before this, I've also never had a personal website - ever. Sure, I maintain
various profiles on different social networks, but I've never had a place of my
own on the internet. I'm also probably the only Rails developer who's never
typed <code>git push heroku</code> in a terminal, but that's a different story.</p>
<h2 id="coding-for-work">Coding For Work</h2>
<p>I'm a pretty methodical person in general, and I take that with me to work. It
comes in handy in this business, but as with everything, it has a cost. It takes
time and effort, but my belief is that the value for my employer or client
outweighs that cost. Some of these items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements vetting</li>
<li>Alternatives analysis</li>
<li>Automated testing, whether through TDD or not</li>
<li>Code review</li>
<li>Maintenance and upkeep of dependencies</li>
<li>Clean commit history throughout the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the results of my actions affect the overall product, my team members,
and all of my business partners, I'm careful and deliberate in the work that I
do.</p>
<h2 id="coding-for-me">Coding For Me</h2>
<p>I decided to stand this site up because I had some content I wanted to maintain,
and I had the blessing of my employer to do so. I needed something quick and
fast that I wouldn't need to put a lot of effort into maintaining.</p>
<p>I also wanted to try out something new, so knowing I only needed a static site
generator, rather than reaching for my comfortable <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>
tool, I instead gave <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> a try. After all, it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world's fastest framework for building websites</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In doing so, I of course ran into some hiccups and problems, but what I'll talk
about here is the process, and how this was different than how I regularly work.</p>
<h3 id="what-goes">What Goes</h3>
<h4 id="alternatives--upfront-analysis">Alternatives &amp; Upfront Analysis</h4>
<p>I went with hugo on name recognition only. I didn't even identify the core
feature set I needed or didn't need; I just dove right in. Similarly, I could have
arduously reviewed the vast number of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a> in
their gallery to find the perfect one, or customized my own. Instead, I chose
three that seemed &ldquo;fine&rdquo; above the fold, and picked the one that I liked best
after a one minute review.</p>
<h4 id="focus">Focus</h4>
<p>When I work from home, I do so from my office, with the door closed. I control
the environment and am particular about what noises or stimuli are present.
However, this is just for me, so instead I sat down on the couch next to my wife
while she was watching something on TV. It's ok if it takes a bit longer, or I'm
a bit distracted, as long as I'm making that trade for me and me alone.</p>
<h3 id="what-stays">What Stays</h3>
<h4 id="verification">Verification</h4>
<p>Testing brings comfort to me and I dislike working without tests. It helps guide
my initial implementation, gives safety for future refactors, and provides
confidence in delivering functionality. And most of the work that I like doing
the most, and as such gravitate towards, rarely has a direct user-facing
component.</p>
<p>However, that's <strong>all</strong> that this site is. I don't want to spend time futzing
with configurations that I don't need to, or meddling with the theme to eek out
performance improvements, or evaluating updating, changing, or removing
dependencies. But I still need to make sure it works. I spent a ton more time in
the browser than I typically do developing for work, but it's the same process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify a thin slice of functionality</li>
<li>Focus on implementing it</li>
<li>Document other observations for future work</li>
<li>Iterate to the next thin slice</li>
<li>Deliver</li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanism by which I worked that process changed (refreshing the browser vs.
running a test), but the process itself stayed the same.</p>
<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>
<p>Sure, my commit messages are definitely not to the degree that I would expect,
hope, or want them to be. However, that doesn't mean that they're worthless.
Particularly on these projects where I'm moving fast, their value is more as
&ldquo;save points&rdquo; than documentation (and I'm not cleaning them up prior to moving
them into a mainline branch), but they can still provide valuable information on
<em>why</em> a change was made.</p>
<p>Additionally, particularly because this is a project that I'm likely to be
revisiting infrequently, I made sure to take the time to add a README that
includes quick examples of all the things I'm going to want to do. For this
project, that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a new post.</li>
<li>Running the server locally.</li>
<li>Deploying the changes (which there's a script for).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Because</em> it's something I won't touch day-to-day, it's even <strong>more</strong> important
to take the few minutes to document those quick commands to save myself the time
of needing to search for it every time that I want to edit this.</p>
<h3 id="what-emerges">What Emerges</h3>
<h4 id="quick-assessment-of-good-enough">Quick Assessment of &ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo;</h4>
<p>There's always an ideal version of what you're looking to accomplish. That
likely manifests itself both in the code itself, as well as the user-facing
product. And we all want to hit that ideal; however, it's not always feasible.
And while I work diligently to reach that at work, I also do my best to be
pragmatic about at least explaining the implications of getting to that ideal,
presenting that to the decision-makers, and working with them to come to an
agreement on how to proceed.</p>
<p>However, in this example, my goal was speed and speed alone. For example, I had
a post to add which had some images that I wanted formatted just so. I couldn't
figure out exactly how to position or size them to my liking. I think from
searching for about 30 minutes I could have gotten there by having the images as
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/">page resources</a>, then using
hugo's <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/">image processing</a>,
and having those available in a <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcode</a>
that I reference in my post.</p>
<p>I could have done that, but instead - I deleted the images. They weren't
tremendously important to the post. They certainly made things look nicer, but
they didn't provide any explanatory value. So I removed them, and freed myself
of the problem. And the page doesn't look exactly how I wanted it to, but it's
done. And if I feel the need to scratch that itch in the future, I know where to
start.</p>
<p>Remember the context under which you're developing, who the decision-makers are,
and what choices you should make based on that. But work to know what you
<strong>aren't</strong> willing to give up in your process, regardless of the context.</p>
