<p>The piece of code I&rsquo;ve written in the last two months most interesting to me isn&rsquo;t anything I&rsquo;ve done for work. It isn&rsquo;t anything I wrote to <a href="https://kevinjmurphy.com/posts/available-for-hire-2022/">find</a> a new job. It doesn&rsquo;t have tests. It doesn&rsquo;t even have a class. It&rsquo;s dirty, not up to my standards, and doesn&rsquo;t handle edge cases. But it does what I need it to.</p>
<h2 id="sad-song">Sad Song <a href="#sad-song">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t (and likely will never) consider myself a guitarist, but I like the guitar. I&rsquo;d like to have a Les Paul to go along with my Stratocaster, but I also like having money for things like food and shelter. I can&rsquo;t justify it in the budget, and that&rsquo;s fine. But maybe I could find something close enough for less money.</p>
<p>I zeroed in on a copy, and I decided on a Firefly. There was only one problem - I couldn&rsquo;t buy one. At least, not from them. Keeping them in stock was problematic. Not only because of supply chain issues, but because of their business model. They batch up a small number of guitars a few times a year for sale. I wasn&rsquo;t the only person with the same plan to buy one. They sell out quickly most of the time.</p>
<p>You can find them on the <a href="https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=Firefly%20FFLPS">secondhand market</a>. Typically, they&rsquo;re priced higher than their new price direct from the manufacturer. The demand is there. They don&rsquo;t make them often enough. And if you want one, you&rsquo;ve got to be fast.</p>
<h2 id="composing-a-number">Composing A Number <a href="#composing-a-number">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>This is about the furthest thing from an important use of my time. Still, I became a bit&hellip;overtaken by the prospect of ordering one. I&rsquo;d refresh the site many times a day, just to check in. Once, I happened to refresh the site when they were uploading their fresh inventory. I was in! But, I did not get to the model I wanted in time. It sold out before I could find it.</p>
<p>Finally, I remembered that computers can do repetitive work for you, and that I knew how to request them to do so. I resolved to stop refreshing their product listing page. At least, I&rsquo;d stop refreshing it myself. I wrote a small script to do it for me.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put this in production at work. It doesn&rsquo;t have consistent formatting! It&rsquo;s not clear exactly what this is doing! It&rsquo;s not tested. Literally. I don&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t have automated tests. I mean I had no idea if this would work. When I wrote it, I couldn&rsquo;t test it against a page that had any products. I found one of their other products that did have inventory in stock, and built it against that. I hoped that the page for this product line would work the same, and that I didn&rsquo;t have a typo.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t keep track of their full inventory. It has no awareness of if there are pages of results. But, it&rsquo;s good enough to tell me that there <em>are</em> guitars for sale. That&rsquo;s a start. Hopefully. I tired of seeing the &ldquo;sold out&rdquo; page. And I wouldn&rsquo;t even know if it would work until that &ldquo;sold out&rdquo; page went away.</p>
<h2 id="automated-playback">Automated Playback <a href="#automated-playback">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Having the script is great, but if I have to run it myself, I might as well refresh the page in my browser. Once again, I needed to remind myself what I do for a living, and how I can ask computers to do things for me. Of course, that only happened when I came across <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">this post</a>. In it, the author uses GitHub Actions to automate diff checks of websites. Now sure, their example was for trivial things like forest fires in California. But I could take the same approach for important things like guitars being in stock.</p>
<p>I modified my script to dump its output to a file, set up the GitHub Action, and subscribed to the repository. When the action pushed a commit because the page changed, I would get an email with a link to the commit. I could use that to then see the list of guitars for sale.</p>
<p>In theory. I still needed to see it happen. Ever.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro <a href="#outro">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>It finally happened. And it just arrived.</p>

<p>Code doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect. It doesn&rsquo;t always need to adhere to your normal standards. Sometimes, it can be good enough to solve a problem you have - especially if it&rsquo;s temporary. Even better if you <em>know</em> it&rsquo;ll be temporary. I&rsquo;ve written lots of &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; code that I&rsquo;m sure is still in production, years later. Writing code like this is a gamble.</p>
<p>But the stakes were incredibly low here. I wouldn&rsquo;t put this in my portfolio if I were looking for a job. It served its purpose though. I&rsquo;m happy to retire this code. Thanks to it, I have other things to play with rather than maintain this.</p>
