</ol>
<p>Have you recently had a conference proposal accepted? Congratulations! Are you wondering, &ldquo;what do I do <em>now</em>?&rdquo; Here is the process I follow to turn my proposal into a full-length talk.</p>
<h2 id="content-generation">Content Generation <a href="#content-generation">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>My first step is to gather all the content I want to talk about as quickly as possible. I know that sounds reductive. Oh, the first step is JUST to put together all your content? How easy! I might as well tell you <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/572078-how-to-draw-an-owl">how to draw an owl</a> next.</p>
<p>&laquo;&laquo;&laquo;&lt; HEAD
But, here&rsquo;s the thing - for a conference talk, I&rsquo;m not starting from scratch. I&rsquo;ve already put a lot of time, and thinking, into the <a href="https://kevinjmurphy.com/posts/sharing-past-conference-proposals/">proposal</a>. For me, that almost always includes a full outline. So I start by revisiting that and seeing what I need to add.</p>
<p>I completed most of my research in the proposal, but I may need to brush up on some details. There may be a book or research paper that I skimmed that I need to go back to and dig into.</p>
<h1 id="will-i-be-using-code-examples-to-demonstrate-some-points-ill-start-writing-some-code-samples-in-my-usual-code-editor-that-show-what-i-want-ill-make-sure-they-run-at-this-point-im-not-concerned-about-how-terse-or-verbose-they-are-im-not-worried-what-the-domain-is-i-need-something-that-shows-the-point-i-want-to-make-i-will-admit-that-sometimes-this-code-generation-process-is-procrastination-i-try-to-call-myself-out-on-that-and-not-put-too-much-effort-into-it-at-this-point">Will I be using code examples to demonstrate some points? I&rsquo;ll start writing some code samples, in my usual code editor, that show what I want. I&rsquo;ll make sure they run. At this point, I&rsquo;m not concerned about how terse or verbose they are. I&rsquo;m not worried what the domain is. I need something that shows the point I want to make. I will admit that sometimes this code generation process is procrastination. I try to call myself out on that and not put too much effort into it at this point. <a href="#will-i-be-using-code-examples-to-demonstrate-some-points-ill-start-writing-some-code-samples-in-my-usual-code-editor-that-show-what-i-want-ill-make-sure-they-run-at-this-point-im-not-concerned-about-how-terse-or-verbose-they-are-im-not-worried-what-the-domain-is-i-need-something-that-shows-the-point-i-want-to-make-i-will-admit-that-sometimes-this-code-generation-process-is-procrastination-i-try-to-call-myself-out-on-that-and-not-put-too-much-effort-into-it-at-this-point">ðŸ”—</a></h1>

<h2 id="shameless-green">Shameless Green <a href="#shameless-green">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>My next step is to put my thoughts together on slides. I use the default theme. White background with black text. Whatever the default font is. I do not care about slide design <strong>at all</strong> at this point.</p>
<p>Some slides are one word. Some are an emoji. Some are a dense block of code. Some start as bullet points. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a thought about what I <em>want</em> the slide to eventually be, like, &ldquo;insert picture of an owl&rdquo;. Everything is a placeholder at this point.</p>
<p>I call this process &ldquo;Shameless Green&rdquo;. I borrowed this term from the book <a href="https://sandimetz.com/99bottles-sample-ruby#_shameless_green">&ldquo;99 Bottles of OOP&rdquo;</a> by Sandi Metz, Katrina Owen, and TJ Stankus. It doesn&rsquo;t match exactly, but it&rsquo;s stuck in my head, so I continue to use it. Intentionally reminding myself to be shameless gives me more license to do that. There&rsquo;s no polish here. This isn&rsquo;t even a first draft; it&rsquo;s only for me - there&rsquo;s no chance of another human seeing this.</p>
<h2 id="first-delivery">First Delivery <a href="#first-delivery">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>After this, I deliver the talk. No, I don&rsquo;t get on stage with it. I don&rsquo;t have an audience. I close the door to my office, stand up, and speak out loud as if I were on a stage - with my slides in front of me on my computer.</p>
<p>This will be <em>rough</em>. I&rsquo;ll feel uncomfortable. I stop to write down when those feelings hit. Not enough to pull me out of my rhythm, but I don&rsquo;t want to forget it.</p>
<p>Some things I might write:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slide 7 - awkward intro</li>
<li>Slide 13 - example doesn&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>Slide 16 - missing context</li>
<li>Slide 32 - repeating info from earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>After I&rsquo;ve gone through everything, I take a few minutes to review my notes. Only to make sure everything is legible and makes sense. I take the time to add more details where needed.</p>
<p>And then I walk away. I&rsquo;ll revisit it later with a fresh perspective.</p>
<h2 id="editing">Editing <a href="#editing">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>I take a few hours to a day away from my initial attempt. I then review the notes while iterating through the slides. What I&rsquo;m looking for here is any <em>structural</em> changes I need to make.</p>
<p>Is there a different order I should present information in? Maybe the section in Slide 32 needs to happen closer to Slide 16. That&rsquo;ll add more context immediately and eliminate the need to repeat myself later on.</p>
<p>If there are any transitions that feel awkward, I dig into why. Am I missing information? Do I have unnecessary information? Do I need to reorder the content? Is there a connection that I need to make more explicit, for myself and the audience?</p>
<p>These changes likely don&rsquo;t get done in one sitting. I revisit a section, or a transition, at a time. Then I review everything in total again. That might spark another round of smaller sections to focus on.</p>
<h2 id="theme">Theme <a href="#theme">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m comfortable with the general flow of information I want to share with the audience. Next, I build my <strong>theme</strong>. I still don&rsquo;t mean slide design here. I mean the real or imaginary <a href="https://kevinjmurphy.com/posts/sharing-past-conference-proposals/#go-all-in-with-a-theme">world</a> that my talk will be about. Some talks have a theme as part of their proposal. For others, I need to develop it at this point.</p>
<p>A theme is important for me in a talk because it turns my presentation into a story. I have a hard time delivering information over that period of time in hard, technical terms. Other people can, and that&rsquo;s great! It doesn&rsquo;t work for me. I need to have some real or imaginary scenario that the content relates to. Most of the time, this involves creating an imaginary product or company. That will illustrate the topics I&rsquo;m sharing with the audience.</p>
<p>I may need to change all my examples to match the theme. The code samples now should reflect that theme. Let&rsquo;s say a talk is using a theme of managing scientific study participants. Code that was using ActiveRecord callbacks to send an email is now sending an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent">informed consent</a> document.</p>
<h2 id="second-delivery">Second Delivery <a href="#second-delivery">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reworked my transitions, moved sections around, and built up a story around my content. Now it&rsquo;s time to run through the presentation again. This time, I take fewer notes, but I also add something.</p>
<p>In this practice session, I start timing the presentation. Where I have discernible sections, I track those as splits/laps (depending on your timer of choice). Talks need to fit within a defined schedule. This is nowhere near polished. Still, the timing gives me a helpful sign of how far off I am from where I need to be.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I discover I&rsquo;m way over on time.</p>
<h2 id="editing-1">Editing <a href="#editing-1">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>In this editing session, I&rsquo;m incorporating the same process from the first edit, but I&rsquo;m adding to it. What am I going to cut entirely? Usually at this point I know what I want to say will take too long and I need to remove pieces. Even if I&rsquo;m on time, I may recognize that there are pieces that don&rsquo;t complement my goal.</p>
<p>This is why I focus on &ldquo;shameless green&rdquo; to start. I haven&rsquo;t invested in picking colors or graphics for my slides. I haven&rsquo;t pored over detailed animations and visuals. Getting rid of content isn&rsquo;t <em>easy</em>, but it&rsquo;s harder (for me) the more work I&rsquo;ve put into it.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve lost all that work you cut forever. First off, it was <strong>necessary</strong> to get what remains to where it is now. You learned something as part of putting that together that&rsquo;ll help you.</p>
<p>You can also reuse it elsewhere. I&rsquo;ve turned sections of presentations I&rsquo;ve had to cut into entirely different talks. Some have become blog posts. If you&rsquo;re not willing to let it go, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit in this format, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be the end. It needs to go somewhere else.</p>
<h2 id="slide-design">Slide Design <a href="#slide-design">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>I am by no means a designer, but I do my best to deliver pleasant slides. Here are some things I look for.</p>
<p>Does the slide complement what I&rsquo;m saying? My speech and the slide should work together, but not be the same. They should highlight what&rsquo;s important without being repetitive. How can I replace words with visuals? I&rsquo;ve turned sentences of text into a single emoji. I&rsquo;ve replaced them with a picture. I try to limit the text on the screen. I want my audience mostly listening to what I&rsquo;m saying, not reading what&rsquo;s behind me.</p>
<p>Are the slides cohesive? I use slide templates to use consistent fonts, color schemes, and layouts. This also makes incorporating large design changes easier later on. Rather than needing to change 80 slides individually, I change the template.</p>
<p>Are my slides accessible? I run my color scheme through a <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">contrast checker</a>. I strive for a WCAG AAA level of contrast between my colors. I typically pick no more than four colors. A consistent background color. A consistent text color. No more than two colors for highlighting or drawing attention to parts of the slide.</p>
<p>Are my slides readable to the audience? I avoid putting any information you need the audience to see on the bottom third of the slides. Someone&rsquo;s head might be in the way. I distill code down to the essentials, even if that means it isn&rsquo;t syntactically valid or complete. I use as large of a font size and as few words as necessary.</p>
<p>&laquo;&laquo;&laquo;&lt; HEAD
I have what&rsquo;s showing on the slide be what you want the audience to focus on. Not what you&rsquo;re going to tell them in two more minutes. I don&rsquo;t have the entire code method on the slide. I have the one line that I&rsquo;m talking about right now. Then the next slide adds the second line to it.</p>
<p>If I ever use any slide builds, each build is a separate slide. I don&rsquo;t use an animation that happens within one slide. It makes it easier to go back and forth between slides, if  necessary.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps <a href="#next-steps">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
