    <h2 id="rubyconf-mini-2022">RubyConf Mini 2022 <a href="#rubyconf-mini-2022">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>RubyConf Mini wrapped up last week in Providence, Rhode Island. This post documents the list of talks I saw. It&rsquo;s not intended as a review of any of the talks, but to highlight the variety of great work from all involved. I hope you&rsquo;ll seek out the full videos of all the sessions that interest you, once they are available.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1 <a href="#day-1">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>The day started with an opening address, which I&rsquo;m sure was lovely, but I&rsquo;ll admit I was a bit distracted. The reason being that I got on stage directly after. Thanks to everyone who attended <a href="https://kevinjmurphy.com/posts/play-guitar/">my session</a>; it was great to see you all.</p>
<p>After that, I moved rooms to see Jeremy Smith&rsquo;s talk, <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Solo:-Building-Successful-Web-Apps-By-Your-Lonesome">&ldquo;Solo: Building Successful Web Apps By Your Lonesome&rdquo;</a>.  The perspective of this talk was from a place of working alone. But, no matter your team size, the conclusions in this session are valuable and relevant.</p>
<p>Next I attended Stephanie Minn&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Empathetic-Pair-Programming-with-Nonviolent-Communication">&ldquo;Empathetic Pair Programming with Nonviolent
Communication&rdquo;</a>. I appreciated how Stephanie showed how to re-word comments in more actionable and helpful ways.</p>
<p>Lindsay Kelly spoke next on <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Knowing-When-To-Walk-Away">&ldquo;Knowing When To Walk Away&rdquo;</a>.  This talk provided good questions to consider when evaluating your current job satisfaction. Questions to ask whether you&rsquo;re actively making a plan to leave a role or not.</p>
<p>We next heard from Barbara Tannenbaum in the first keynote on &ldquo;Persuasive Communication&rdquo;. The speakers I spoke with after were excitedly applying these tips in their sessions. Even if you&rsquo;re not public speaking, there&rsquo;s much to learn here.</p>
<p>The agenda for the day wrapped up with a Podcast Panel. All those voices you hear in your headphones are real people! Brittany Martin, Julie, Drew Bragg, JoÃ«l Quenneville and Andy Croll all took part in this conversation. I believe you should expect to hear it soon in your podcast feed, if you follow <em>any</em> of their shows.</p>
<h2 id="day-2">Day 2 <a href="#day-2">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>I started the second day by throwing something out on social media that I want to highlight here. If you find yourself at a conference, and you see a speaker after a talk you were at, let them know that you were there. If there was something you liked about it (particularly if it&rsquo;s specific), tell them!</p>
<p>I can be a great conversation starter. It can be <strong>super</strong> meaningful to speakers. Being able to talk about my talk before and after the talk is my cheat code. It helps me feel more comfortable in social interactions in conferences. I&rsquo;m not great at going up and talking to people. If you saw my talk, or see my badge that says I&rsquo;m a speaker, maybe you&rsquo;ll bring it up. Now we have something in common to talk about.</p>
<p>Speakers put a lot of time and effort into their preparation. Knowing that people were there, and even better that they got something out of it, can make a big difference in <em>their</em> conference experience.</p>
<p>Nadia Odunayo started today&rsquo;s program with A Ruby Mystery Story keynote. It&rsquo;s a fun romp told in a delightful manner that&rsquo;s a very entertaining watch.</p>
<p>I stayed in the ballroom for Aji Slater to introduce <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Zen-and-the-Art-of-Incremental-Automation">&ldquo;Zen and the Art of Incremental Automation&rdquo;</a>. Beyond the theory of applying these changes, the fallout of practicing (or not) the tips provided a grounded perspective.</p>
<p>Vladimir Dementyev next took the stage for <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Weaving-and-seaming-mocks">&ldquo;Weaving and seaming mocks&rdquo;</a>. Vladimir is always pushing improved tooling and support in so many different areas. This talk was no different, introducing a different way of verifying mocks in tests.</p>
<p>Kevin Newton discussed <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Syntax-Tree">&ldquo;Syntax Tree&rdquo;</a> and how parsing code can lead to further inspection, debugging, and formatting opportunities.</p>
<p>Ernesto Tagwerker warned us that <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Here-Be-Dragons:-The-Hidden-Gems-of-Tech-Debt">&ldquo;Here Be Dragons: The Hidden Gems of Tech Debt&rdquo;</a>. It provided a fun classification of tools to surface problem areas in your code. After identifying potential issues, it proposed strategies to handle them.</p>
<p>At the Transgender Issues Panel, we listened to their stories. I thank them for sharing.</p>
<p>Julia Evans closed the program for the day with a keynote around DNS. This proposes strategies for long-term learning, providing tangible steps to follow.</p>
<h2 id="day-3">Day 3 <a href="#day-3">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Day 3 opened with a sponsor panel discussing how each of the sponsors provides an inclusive workspace, and what that means to them.</p>
<p>We then heard from a variety of speakers in Lightning Talks. We heard about what open source can learn from co-operatives, academic research about Ruby, and much more.</p>
<p>Andrea Fomera and Julie then spoke on <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Inclusivity:-Hiring-is-just-the-beginning">&ldquo;Inclusivity: Hiring is just the beginning&rdquo;</a>. I aspire to their honesty on stage and at work.</p>
<p>Brittany Martin then came in strong on short notice off the wait list to present
<a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#We-Need-Someone-Technical-on-the-Call">&ldquo;We Need Someone Technical on the Call&rdquo;</a>. This provided a framework to prepare, execute, and follow up on a meeting.</p>
<p>JoÃ«l Quenneville then took the stage and started <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Teaching-Ruby-to-Count">&ldquo;Teaching Ruby to Count&rdquo;</a>. Introducing different iteration mechanisms is great. JoÃ«l taking the next step about how to apply that to our own code (and why) was a pleasure to watch.</p>
<p>Jenny Shih explained how to incorporate functional principles in our Ruby code during <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Functional-programming-for-fun-and-profit!!">Functional programming for fun and profit!!</a>. Jenny took great care to present these terms and philosophies in an approachable way that was immediately actionable.</p>
<p>Jared Norman next spoke of <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#TDD-on-the-Shoulders-of-Giants">&ldquo;TDD on the Shoulders of Giants&rdquo;</a>. This explored different TDD styles, leaving us with patterns to apply in our tests.</p>
<p>Budding game show host Drew Bragg next asked, <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Who-Wants-to-be-a-Ruby-Engineer?">&ldquo;Who Wants to be a Ruby Engineer?&rdquo;</a>. Audience participants did their best on stage, battling with confusing and esoteric Ruby syntax. The energy in the room was buzzing.</p>
<p>Rose Wiegley closed the conference with a keynote on &ldquo;Leading From Where You Are&rdquo;. No matter your title at work, and whether you see yourself as a leader or not, I expect you&rsquo;ll learn a lot from this session.</p>
<h2 id="appreciation">Appreciation <a href="#appreciation">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://jemma.dev/">Jemma Issroff</a>, without whom this conference wouldn&rsquo;t exist. Without whom we wouldn&rsquo;t have had this time together. After RailsConf, I told myself I was taking a break from speaking for a while. And then this opportunity came along, and it was too compelling to not TRY to be a part of. Thanks for the push.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.emilysamp.dev/">Emily Samp</a> who helped all the speakers learn what they needed to know in preparation for the event.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://andycroll.com/">Andy Croll</a> for offering his prior experience running conferences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to say to you, ballroom projector. You worked great during the A/V check on Monday, but you weren&rsquo;t there for me in my time of need. You disappointed me. Thank you for playing nicer with the rest of the speakers.</p>
<p>Thank you to the <a href="https://www.confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a> and hotel A/V staff, who professionally and calmly worked to troubleshoot the issue, while I blankly stared at the audience. When I&rsquo;m practicing, I tell myself I need to prepare enough to give my talk without any slides or notes. I practice on walks, away from my material. I practice looking the other direction (checking occasionally to make sure I&rsquo;m clicking to the right slide). In those moments on stage, I was wondering if my preparation would become necessary. Would I have to give my full talk without any slides?</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://www.drbragg.dev/">Drew Bragg</a> for unflinchingly handing me his laptop from the front row, letting me git clone the repo that has my slides on it. I ran the presentation from his computer, having never used it before.</p>
<p>Thanks to the conference WiFi. It actually WORKED that morning, allowing me to get my deck onto Drew&rsquo;s machine.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/joelquen">JoÃ«l Quenneville</a> for unsurprisingly being the first person to approach me after I finished on stage. He was quick with a reassuring compliment and gave me feedback that&rsquo;ll stick with me for quite some time.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://danielmagliola.com/">Daniel Magliola</a>, who couldn&rsquo;t be with us, for leaving a message in my inbox right around the time I wrapped up on stage. Just checking in on how it went. What a treat.</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://bookbub.com/">BookBub</a> colleagues who provided feedback on an early version of my talk, and covered for me at work so I could be here this week.</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://dockwa.com/">Dockwa</a> friends, some old and some new. It was great to spend time with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy <a href="https://konnor.netlify.app/">Konnor Rogers</a> joined us. Thanks for fitting us into your week&rsquo;s plans, and making time to come along.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://brittanymartin.dev/">Brittany Martin</a> for being as great a conversationalist in person as she is in an interview.</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone who scrolled through this whole thing, thinking, &ldquo;surely Kevin will mention me next.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re handling it great! (Also, sorry?)</p>
<p>Thanks to my wife, who tactfully asked, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re doing this again?&rdquo; only once when I told her I got accepted. It&rsquo;s not only the time this week to help with childcare, but all the time leading up to it she afforded me to prepare.</p>
<p>With that, I&rsquo;m exhausted, and overwhelmed, in a good way. Until next time, #RubyFriends &lt;3.</p>
